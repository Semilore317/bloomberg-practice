# Self-review guide — Connection Pool

This file is for AFTER the exercise. It lists what strong candidates tend to
notice. It is not a patch: there is no corrected code here, only the observations
that lead you to one.

Strong candidates often notice:

- acquire does not check whether the pool is closed
- acquire does not enforce capacity, so the pool can exceed its size
- release has no status guard, so an idle connection can be released again
- the invariant in_use + idle <= capacity should always hold
- a double release inflates the idle count above capacity
- a real pool would need locking around acquire and release

If you found and fixed the failing tests and can explain each fix in terms of the
invariant it protects, you did the exercise well.
