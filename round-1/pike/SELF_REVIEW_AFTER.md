# Self-review guide - Document Approval Workflow

This file is for AFTER the exercise. It lists what strong candidates tend to
notice. It is not a patch: there is no corrected code here, only the observations
that lead you to one.

Strong candidates often notice:

- approve has no state guard, so a rejected or already-approved doc can be approved
- withdraw has no state guard, so a decided doc can be withdrawn
- pending_count counts every document, not only the PENDING ones
- PENDING is the only non-terminal state
- reject already guards correctly; approve and withdraw should match it
- every transition should start from PENDING

If you reproduced each issue with a test you wrote, fixed it, and can explain each
fix in terms of the invariant it protects, you did the exercise well.
