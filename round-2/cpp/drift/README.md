# Fulfillment Service

Welcome to the team that promises stock to orders. A catalog of SKUs, physical on-hand inventory,
and a reservation book combine into an availability view: what can still be promised is the
on-hand count minus what is already reserved.

This repository has three reported problems in `tickets/`. Your interviewer will tell you which
ticket to start with. You are not expected to finish every ticket.

You may use the available AI assistant and normal repository tools. Treat the assistant like a
junior developer: establish a plan, inspect its work, run the tests, and retain ownership of the
result.

## Scope

In scope: work the tickets in `tickets/`, fixing the defects they report and
confirming each with a test you write. Keep all existing, correct behaviour working.

Out of scope: redesigning the services, changing public APIs, or adding features no
ticket asks for.

Time budget: about 45 minutes.

## Reproduce and test it yourself

This pack ships no tests. The code is the same in `python/`, `cpp/`, and `java/`;
write a test that reproduces the reported behaviour, confirm it fails, fix the
code, and keep your own test green.

## Product rules already agreed

- availability is on-hand minus active reservations;
- a reservation is never granted beyond availability;
- releasing a reservation returns its stock to availability;
- an unknown SKU is rejected at the boundary.


## How to run

This pack ships no tests. Pick one language and write your own tests to reproduce and verify fixes. See instructions below.

# Setup

This pack ships no tests, on purpose. Read the tickets, form a hypothesis about
what is wrong, and write your own tests to confirm it before you change anything.
The same service exists in Python, C++, and Java; pick one.

## Python 3.9+

Write test files named `test_*.py` under `python/` (a `conftest.py` is already
there so your imports resolve), then:

```bash
cd python && pytest -q
```

## C++ (g++ with -std=c++17)

The implementation is header-only. Write your own `test.cpp` that includes the
headers, then:

```bash
cd cpp && g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test && ./test
```

## Java (JDK 11+)

Write your own `Check.java` with a `main` that exercises the classes, then:

```bash
cd java && javac *.java && java Check
```


## Running tests

Write your own `test.cpp` that includes the headers, then:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test && ./test
```
